MORGAN STARTER
----------------------------
;Ralts and Kirlia are absolutely abysmal pokemon and very unfun to use. Wanting to encourage the player to use Ralts for story related purposes, these stat buffs hope to bring them in line with kanto/johto starters, allowing it to be a  solid pokemon during the early/mid game

RALTS
TYPE PSYCHIC > PSYCHIC/FAIRY
HP 25 > 40
DEF 25 > 35
SPE 40 > 50
SPA 45 > 65

KIRLIA
TYPE PSYCHIC > PSYCHIC/FAIRY
HP 38 > 50
SPE 50 > 60
SPA 65 > 75
SPD 55 > 65

;Gardevoir while a decent single player 'mon typically is completely outclassed by Alakazam and its other Psychic Bretheren. While the fairy type is a notable buff in itself helping it set itself apart, it does not feel like a proper reward to the player for sticking with ralts. These buffs are an inbetween of vanilla gardevoir and its mega form, to encourage the player to stick with their starter throughout the game while not being so over the top that it pushes Alakazam out from being a viable option.

GARDEVOIR
TYPE PSYCHIC > PSYCHIC/FAIRY
SPE 80 > 100
SPA 125 > 135
SPD 115 > 125






KANTO/JOHTO STARTS
-------------------------

;Kanto/Johto starters without any dreamworld abilities or mega evolutions are significantly worse than DPP starters. These changes hope to bring them more in line and hope to give some uniqueness when lacking.

;Lopunny without its Mega has little to set itself appart from the other normal rodent pokes, with most outclassing her due to at least being good HM slaves. This change hopes to find middleground between vanilla lopunny and its mega in order to make it a usable but not absurd pokemon. While having a typing unique to this game in Normal/Fighting

;Masquerain goes from the very unique typing of bug water to a generic bug flying with nothing to distinguish itself. We want to give Masquerain its unique identity back and give it some small buffs to see just what its capable of doing.
